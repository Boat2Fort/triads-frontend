## 📖 About

Triads is a single-player, untimed word puzzle game where you identify a single keyword that links three different cue words to form a **Triad**. Once you solve three initial Triads, the three keywords become your final challenge—solve all four Triads to win!

The game features beautiful physics-based bubble animations, smooth gameplay, and comprehensive statistics tracking—all without requiring any login or personal information.

## 🎮 How to Play

### The Basics

You're given **9 bubbles** containing words or phrases called **cues**. Your goal is to find **3 cues** that share a common **key word** to form a **3-word Triad**. a key is always a stand-alone word uniquely shared by the 3 cues.

**Example:** `SECOND-`, `POKER`, `SHAKE` → The key word is **"HAND"**, completing:

- SECOND-**HAND**
- POKER **HAND**
- **HAND**SHAKE

### Game Flow

1. **Initial State**: Start with 9 cue words in floating bubbles
2. **Find a Triad**: Select three cues that share a common keyword
3. **Solve the Triad**: Enter your guess for the keyword
4. **Repeat**: Solve a second and third Triad
5. **Final Challenge**: The three keywords from the first three Triads become new cues for the final, fourth Triad
6. **Win**: Solve all four Triads to win the game!

### Hints and Turns

- **3 turns** and **2 hints** available (any combination)
- **Miss a guess** = lose a turn
- **Take a hint** = lose a turn

**Hint Types:**

- **When 9 or 6 cues remain**: Highlights a Triad and shows the keyword length
- **When 3 cues remain**: Also shows the keyword's first letter

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm/yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd triads-frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment**

    Update `src/environments/environment.ts` with your API URL:

    ```typescript
    export const environment = {
    	production: false,
    	apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api',
    	timeout: 10000,
    }
    ```

4. **Start development server**

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

### Standalone Classic web build

The repository also produces the independently hosted, unlimited Classic edition:

```bash
pnpm start:classic       # local Classic edition at http://localhost:4200
pnpm build:classic       # production artifact in dist/triads-classic/browser
```

Deploy the contents of `dist/triads-classic/browser` to `triads-classic.gametrix.org` with SPA fallback to `index.html`. The build uses the shared production API at `https://triads-api.gametrix.org/api`; add `https://triads-classic.gametrix.org` to the backend `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable before serving it publicly. DNS, TLS, and web-server provisioning are managed outside this repository.
